See also the demo: @file('live-demo/timeout-alarm.txt'),
        which uses same program: @file('demo-code/za-loop-read.c').


Rationale for using read() syscall as an example:

  (1) Reading/receiving is the most obviously blocking operation: 
        you cannot receive what was not yet sent / typed in the terminal.

  (2) For the demo we can easily control the timing of inputs, 
        whether standard input is a terminal or a FIFO.

  Compare to write(), which is not so obviously blocking --- 
  we would need to explain the multiple levels of buffering; 
  more important, it's much harder to _delay_ write() completion = 
  _immediately_ force write() to block, from the user interface / CLI.

  Indirectly causing write() to block by letting a pipe to fill 
  seems less convincing; it's a subtler issue, definitely worth teaching, 
  but it's not what _this_ demonstration intends to cover.

We can use 'cat' command to feed data into the writing end of the FIFO. 
Control-D will terminate 'cat' command's input, eventually causing 
an EOF condition / indication at the reading end of the FIFO.

This does _not_ mean that a Control-D character is passed through the pipe! 

We can try other ways to terminate the 'cat' command:
  - sending SIGTERM with the 'kill' command,
  - Control-C (same as above actually, but the terminal takes care of signal generation)

TODO: check the above, maybe something is wrong


We can also use 'echo' to feed data into the writing end of the FIFO. 
In this case the input is delimited / determined by the shell's parser 
(it's not interactive), so there is no need for a convention to delimit it
